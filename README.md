TypeScript Puppeteer Wait for Navigation with Url Hash Change Demo
==================================================================

I disabled "/favicon.ico" requests in 'index.html' to avoid unexpected requests.

```
npm install -g puppeteer
npm run demo
```

Note: since puppeteer needs to download a very huge Chrome which makes the installation quite slow,
I prefer install puppeteer globally and link it to this project before running.
